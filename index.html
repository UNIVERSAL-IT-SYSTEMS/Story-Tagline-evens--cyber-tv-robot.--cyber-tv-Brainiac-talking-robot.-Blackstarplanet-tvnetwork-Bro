ID 33363200 www.realestate.com http://www.microsoftstore.com/store?Action Protecting Online Accounts As the number of activities you conduct online increases, so do the chances your online accounts may be compromised by persons who want access to your personal information. There are several steps you can take to protect yourself and ensure your personal information does not fall into the wrong hands. Steps to Protect Your Online Accounts IntelÂ´s Tukwila chip contains more than 2 billion transistors - twice the number from two years ago. Intel has just announced the first microchip that contains more than two billion transistors - tiny switches that together perform the calculations in computers. The chip, known as Tukwila, marks a milestone in chip density technology. Create Strong Passwords The more difficult the password, the harder it is for someone to gain access to your account. Use a mixture of numbers and letters as well as both upper and lowercase letters. Change Passwords Often By changing your passwords on a frequent basis, you decrease the likelihood that someone else can gain access to your account. Use Different Passwords Across Websites If you use the same username and password combination for multiple websites, chances are that if someone gets your information for one website, they will be able to access your other accounts, which increases the risk of your personal information being compromised. If you are notified by one company that your account has been accessed, and you have used the same username/password combination on other websites, you should change them all immediately. Check Your Credit Card Charges Be vigilant about ensuring all your charges are legitimate. If you&#39;ve stored credit card information in an account and someone is able to log in, they may be able to make purchases using your financial information. If you see any fraudulent charges, contact your credit card or bank and the retailer through which the order was placed to have the charges removed and, of course, change your log-in information on that account. You may also want to delete credit card information from your accounts to limit the possibility of fraudulent charges being made. Action Items After an Unauthorized Access to an Online Account Breach Not only should you change your passwords, but if the site has security questions, change those, too. Also, validate the personal information in your account is correct and hasn&#39;t been changed by someone else. Use Anti-Virus Software These programs will help prevent exposing your computer to viruses which in turn may allow others to access your personal information both on your computer and on websites. Be on the Lookout for Phishing and Smishing Scams Phishing scams arrive in your e-mail, while smishing scams come to you in text messages.

<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to GitHub Pages.</h3>

<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<h3>
<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
